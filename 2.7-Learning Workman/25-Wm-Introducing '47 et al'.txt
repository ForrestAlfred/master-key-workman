To reach the top row '4' you will move your arm slightly forward while rolling your other fingers (L2) (L3) (L4), keeping them on their home keys so you won't lose your orientation on the keyboard.  Do the mirror of this with your right hand to reach the '7'.  Then to reach the '$' hold down the right shift key with your right pinky and type '4' and to type the '&' use your left pinky on the left shift key and type the '7'.AOEUHTNSD-.YCVGJ/PR;IB,LKWQMXFZ<paragraphmarker>47'0
